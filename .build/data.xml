    <schema:description>
        After taking this course you'll:

        - have an overview of basic standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL, SPARQL) in semantic technologies
        - have a good understanding of the theoretical foundation for such technologies, both in terms of semantics and
        syntactic reasoning
        - know how to use libraries to use the technology in their own applications
        - know about ontologies: what they are, how to make them, what to use them for
        - have an overview of existing applications
        - be able to use semantic technologies to solve issues in web development, data integration and data transfer

    <schema:description>
       A meetup group for anyone interested in Knowledge Graphs (KGs), data exchange, linked data, accessible semantics
       of data, and moving from data to knowledge.

       Topics of interest:
       * W3C Stack (RDF, RDFS, SPARQL, OWL, SHACL), and surrounding tools and technologies
       * Neo4j and other LPG implementations
       * NLP, LLM, ML &amp; GenAI related to KGs

       If you have something you want to share with the community, please reach out and we can schedule an event! ðŸŒŸ
